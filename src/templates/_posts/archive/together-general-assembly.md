# Together: A case study

Flashback to May 2014 in Ho Chi Minh City. It's the summer monsoon season and it sweltering hot. Being the first time to my native country without a family to translate it has proven more stressful. My Vietnamese isn't the best and so the locals treat me as an outsider. "Luckily" I thought, "I had Yelp loaded onto my phone". "One less thing to think about".  

## The outcome

"Together" allows users to Discover events and activities curated by their network of friends. "Together" displays what the user's friends are sharing in a personalised newsfeed of events and activities. The user can share what they find in a "Meetup", an open forum where they can discuss their next outing. Users can create a "Meetup", a forum where they can share their discoveries and organise

This is a user experience case study completed during my time at General Assembly. By understanding the user's pain points, "Together" was brought to life as an alternative to discovery applications such as Tripadvisor and Yelp. I've discovered through this project that event suggestions from strangers is not enough, but personalised content from the people you trust is the key to discovering the best events around town.


## My Role

* Conducted user surveys and interviews
* Developed user personas
* Devised features, information architecture and content strategy
* Created user flows, sketches and wireframes with Axure
* Utilised Invision app to create a working protoype

## Research

### Findings Surveys and User Interviews

Questions for surveys and interviews cover broad topics, which then narrow down to more specific questions to get a deeper understanding of the user. Users took part in a set of behavioural tasks, the results were insights into their methods of discovering and sharing. Through this task I've discovered that having a strong understanding of the user is was the key to***

Topics and tasks include:

* What tools were they using to discover events and activities?
* How were users sharing content?
* Who were users sharing content with?
* How would you organise an outing with your closest friends on a weekend?

Key take aways extracted from 8 surveys and 2 user interviews. 

* Curated city guides such as Time Out, Broadsheet and Concrete Playground were the favourite go to sources when searching for things to do. 

* Applications like Yelp and Tripadvisor were rated as the least favourite go to source.no

* Users were more likely to ask friends and family for advice on activities than consult an app. They found they were more satisfied with suggestions from people they trust

* Users stated they did not trust the advice from applications such as Tripadvisor and Yelp.

* Through interviews, users found discovery applications have a high learning curve. They found messaging apps as the more convenient sharing method.

* Users mentioned that the comments left on places in Foursquare were either unnoteworthy or attempts to promote the business through black hat techniques 

## User Personas and Problem statements

Three user personas were created from the results of the surveys and interviews. When formulating the personas, I focused on the user's behavioural traits and the pain points they've encountered when using existing applications. 

The personas represented a core user base. It had an integral role in governing future design decisions such as features, content, user flows and workflows. 

Theresa

Jamie

Nadia


Using INTUIT's method cards, I created prblem statements to summarise the pain points of each persona. The problem statement includes who the persona is, what they're trying to achieve and their emotions. This task characterises the persona and creates an empathy bridge between the designer and the user base.

I am [persona name, 3 characteristics]. I am trying to [outcome/job/task], but [problem/barrier] because [root cause]. This makes me feel [emotion].

Theresa

> I'm Theresa, a student and apprentice chef from Sydney. I spend most of my time at school, but I try to stay in touch with friends as much as possible. I'm seen as the decision maker in the group.

> I've used apps like Yelp and Tripadvisor before to plan catch-ups, but I find the suggestions doesn't suit my taste. I'm often disappointed when I use those services.

Jamie

> I'm Jamie, an electrician from Southern Highlands. I'm an outdoorsman and love big adventures.

> I rarely use discovery apps because it's hard to find activities I like. I usually stick to websites like adventure.com or a simple google search because I have more control.

Nadia

> I'm Nadia and I'm a Manager from Sydney. If I'm not spending time with my partner or out of town for work, I'm out with my friends.

> I find applications difficult to use, it's much simpler for me to ask for someone else's advice. I feel left out as I'm always doing the same things.


## Information Architecture [Expand]

Below is the current structural design of Together. The application remains relatively flat with 2 levels information. Maintaining a flat structure addresses one of the key pain points, that existing applications had high learning curve. Users mentioned they they were often lost when searching for advice on Forusquare, additional content such as tips, comments and ratings made it hard for them to relocate back to the home screen. 

Once features and content were determined they were categorised through a card sort. This was undertaken by 2 participants, who were given a brief explanation of what the mobile application was. The users were asked to group features and content that they would expect to be see in sections of an application. 

Key takeaways from this task include: 

* Notifications was grouped under the profile page, as it details messages pertaining to the user. 
* The task of adding friends went under both the Newsfeed section and the User Profile section. 


## User Goals and User Flow

User flows were created by determining the user goals and tasks users needed to succeed. User flows were initially sketched on paper, revised to account for error handling and finalised in Axure, a wireframing tool used commonly in UX design houses. 

## Sketches, Wireframes and Protoype

The following diagrams illustrate the progress from initial ideas and sketches to the final wireframes and prototype. The process I undertook to produce Together was to start with smaller objects, and work from the ground up to build a functioning prototype. In my final prototype, I added visuals and design to illustrate what the final product would look like. The prototype was built with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Invision App, a free cloud based prototyping tool.
