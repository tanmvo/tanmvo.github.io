# JCurve POS

JCurve POS is a Point of Sale system for B2B transactions. The POS is an application which integrates with the JCurve user's CRM and stock management system. JCurve users needed a solution in stores to handle face-to-face sales as transactions processed through the accounting system proved difficult and time consuming. 

JCurve commissioned Taos Creative to do a heuristic analysis of the system and suggest improvements to the process from product search to sale.
