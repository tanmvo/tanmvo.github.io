## Sensis Email Preference Manager

*Intro about thing*

"Keeping Connected"

When it comes to keeping in contact with customers, Sensis rely upon emails to communicate messages. Messages range from important transactions, product updates, to social events. Users aren't all the same, and Sensis were finding customers wanted more control over what types of messages they receive. The existing opt out process disabled all messages, removing them from all important messaging. Taos Creative was employed to design an opt-down process, which gives customers the ability to choose the content they receive in their inbox. 

My Role

<li>Project Manager, scope project to develop a timeline and deliverable date for client</li>
<li>Initiate meetings to produce a list of requirements from various stakeholders</li>
<li>Develop lo-fidelity prototypes, based on existing user research and requirements</li>
<li>Produced technical documentation and hi-fidelity prototypes for external suppliers</li>
<li>Built a responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, JQuery and Javascript</li>

The thing

The opt down process allows users to select the types of message on the left hand column. The column on the right evaluates the users choices, displaying what they will and will not receive. On submission, users are given a confirmation message to signify that their details have been updated. Users can either exit or make further changes to their profile.


Process

During initial sketches, the opt down page detailed a 4 column layout. Each column contained a message category and short description of each category, as a means of displaying as much information as possible. After testing, users stated they were overwhelmed by the design, as they was too much information to process. 

Our second redesign produced a prototype with 2 columns, one column was a list of checkboxes with the categories, and one detailing what the categories were. Separating the information into two columns to allow the user to focus on the task at hand, and then evaluate their choices before proceeding with the changes. User tests revealed that the task of selecting choices was much easier than the first design.

Technical documentation was produced for external suppliers. It consisted of a brief outline, an Axure prototype, and user journeys. The outline discussed the current pain points of the existing unsubscribe process and the tasks needed to achieve the goal. The Axure prototype was supplied to demonstrate the Interaction between the user and the interface, as well as showcase the design language. The user journeys were an effective tool as it allowed suppliers to role play use cases to get a better understanding of the tool. 

Goals achieved from technical documentation:

* Task alignment and organisation within all teams
* Fulfillment of project requirements
* Ensure sensitive data was handled correctly
* Interactive components was conveyed with detail and precision
* Functionality was demonstrated clearly through the use of user journeys
