# Choice Hotels Competitions

*Intro about thing*

Choice Hotels approached Taos Creative to create a microsite to host their online competitions. The competitions were exclusive to Choice Hotels customers, therefore the client needed a secure gateway for users to log in. 

## My role

<li>Define user goals and tasks, balancing their needs with business requirements</li>
<li>Produce workflows to map out user journey</li>
<li>Create wireframes to demonstrate functionality</li>
<li>Lead team of developers to implement responsive microsite</li>

We created a process where users can enter their unique ID which will grant access and automatically fill in the competition form. To entice users to subscribe to the company's Facebook page, we added a facebook plugin so entrants could "like" the page and receive additional rewards.
